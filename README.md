# Refresher C

Reconnect with the lowest high-level programming language - [C][0]! :neckbeard:

## Description

This repo provides code examples with descriptive comments which help relearn what you have forgotten about C.

This project is primarily structured around [this][1] tutorial. If you are learning C from scratch, I recommend using that tutorial instead of this project.

Code examples in the 'hours' directory have been named according to the online tutorial's lessons.

## How to compile and run code

On Linux, first ensure presence of `cc` or `gcc`. Then:

```
gcc code_file.c -o executable_file
./executable_file
```

For non-Linux system, you will need to [Google it][2].
