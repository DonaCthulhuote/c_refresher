# C Refresher :neckbeard:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/c_refresher.svg?branch=master)][0]

Reconnect with the lowest high-level programming language - [C][1]!

## Description

This repository provides code examples with descriptive comments.

Samples in this project more-or-less follow [this excellent tutorial][2]. If you are completely new to C, I highly recommend that tutorial.

## FAQ

### How to compile and run code?

[Google "how to run C code"][3] for your particular operating system.

### How should you go through the examples?

Carefully read each code file (ordered by name) in the 'samples' directory.

### Why does this project exist?

Mainly, this project helped me quickly refresh my C concepts.

Additionally however, I wanted to help programmers of C-written high level languages who want to (begin to) understand their language's source code.
