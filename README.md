# C Refresher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/c_refresher.svg?branch=master)][0]

Reconnect with the lowest high-level programming language - [C][1]! :neckbeard:

## Description

This repo provides code examples with descriptive comments which help relearn what you have forgotten about C.

This project is primarily structured around [**Sams Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours**][2] tutorial. If you are learning C from scratch, I highly recommend that tutorial.

Code examples in the 'hours' directory have been named according to the online tutorial's lessons.

## FAQ

### How to compile and run code

#### Linux

First ensure the presence of `cc` or `gcc`. Then:

```
gcc code_file.c -o executable_file
./executable_file
```

#### Non-Linux

[Google it][3].

### How should you go through the examples?

Carefully read each code file (ordered by name) in the 'hours' directory.

### Why does this project exist?

I mainly wanted to help programmers who want to (begin to) understand the source code of the C-written high level language they daily use. (That's also why I haven't covered concepts my target audience will already know e.g. how to name a function.)
