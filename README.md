# C Refresher :neckbeard:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/c_refresher.svg?branch=master)][0]

Reconnect with the lowest high-level programming language - [C][1]!

## Description

This repository provides code examples with descriptive comments.

Samples in this project more-or-less follow [this excellent tutorial][2]. If you are completely new to C, I highly recommend that tutorial.

## FAQ

### How to compile and run code?

You can either use [this very helpful][3] website or you can [Google "how to run C code"][4] for your particular operating system.

### How should you go through the examples?

Carefully read each code file (ordered by name) in the 'samples' directory.

The outputs of commands are included as comments in the sample files.

### Why does this project exist?

Mainly, this project helped me quickly refresh my C concepts.

Additionally however, I wanted to help programmers of C-written high level languages in beginning to understand their language's source code.
