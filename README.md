# C Refresher :neckbeard:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/c_refresher.svg?branch=master)][0]

## Description

This repository is intended for people who want to relearn the basic concepts of C by going through code samples.

Comments in the code include enough description for guidance - comments include command outputs as well.

These code samples follow [this excellent tutorial][2] more-or-less.

Neither the tutorial nor these samples comprehensively cover C; for that, I recommend [this book][5].

## FAQ

### How to compile and run code?

You can either use [this very helpful][3] website or you can [Google "how to run C code"][4] for your particular operating system.

### How should you go through the examples?

Open and read each code file (ordered by name) in the 'samples' directory.
