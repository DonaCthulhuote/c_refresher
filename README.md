# C Refresher :neckbeard:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/c_refresher.svg?branch=master)][0]

## Description

This repository is intended for people who want to relearn the basic concepts of C by going through code samples.

Simply go through the files in the `samples` directory, alphabetically. Comments in the code include enough description for guidance - comments include command outputs as well.

These samples **DO NOT** comprehensively cover C; for that, I recommend [this book][5].

## Contribute

Open a descriptive issue to point out any errors you find. I will accept resolving pull requests as long as they follow the same code and commenting style present in the existing sample code.
